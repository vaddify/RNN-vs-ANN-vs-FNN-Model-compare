# RNN-vs-ANN-vs-FNN-Model-compare
Lets build a Classification Model using Python PyTorch that can predict whether a user will click on an online-ad based on given factors. 

## Objective:
Let us Python/PyTorch to build ***ANN, RNN and FNN*** and compare the performance of the each model.

For this experiment, lets use following dataset which contains information about whether a user clicked on an online ad as well as the following factors:

**Features:**

Daily time spent on site
Age
Area income
Daily internet usage
Ad topic line
City
Male
Country
Timestamp
Clicked on ad
